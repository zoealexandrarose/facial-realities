  <div class="paragraph" <p>Facial modification has existed in its broadest form for centuries. Whether chosen to do cosmetically or surgically, changing or specifically enhancing certain facial features is an old concept that continues to evolve in
    more modern ways. In 2020, where facial recognition technology is fast becoming the new normal, it is argued that is a person’s basic human right to alter and cosmetically enhance their face in any way that they choose.
    The possibilities widen when we consider the ability to alter how you look not just in real life, but also online – for some, adjusting their appearance digitally is what can lead to decisions to change their face ‘offline’. Whether it’s a
    snapchat filter that smoothens the skin or makes you look like someone you’re not, or a video online of you doing or saying something you haven’t really done – as in, a deepfake – the technological spread of augmented facial reality ranges
    from the superficial to the more sinister, and with harsher implications and consequences.

      <h1 style="font-size: 23px; color: black;"><strong>At Face Value</strong></h1>
      <p>In a world where over 30 million Instagram accounts exist, there is no doubt that social media has transformed the way we see ourselves. In some ways, Instagram enables this, influencing our perception of ourselves and the way we look through filters and effects.
        Whilst the app can help to introduce more inclusive ideas of beauty, with images of imperfections going viral and inspiring many to post similar photos, academic research shows that Instagram often does far worse than good, in more subtle and deceptive ways. </p>
      <br>
      <p>The rise of augmented reality filters and effects across social media has never been stronger. If you can’t afford – or can’t stomach – to get lip and cheek fillers, but might be interested in seeing what you may look like if you could, look
        no further than the world’s favourite photo sharing app. The possibilities are endless, with effects that will transform you into a bug-eyed green alien, give you freckles you never had, or place piercings where you may have been thinking of
        getting one. It’s enjoyable, it can be funny, and is clearly artistic on multiple levels – until a slight wrong move, and the filter flickers off.</p>

      <p>“What I love the most about filters is that you can transform yourself and your reality into anything you can imagine. You can be that fantasy,” says Florencia Solari, creator of the ‘Vedette+++” filter. With over 19.6 million uses within
        two and a half weeks of its launch, the filter shows the users face with extreme cosmetic surgery and a slight sheen to their skin. “Art imitates life,” she tells i-D magazine. “For many people, they’re just curious about how they’d look,
        exploring a different online persona.”</p>
      <br>
      <p>Similar to Solari, digital designer Teresa Fogolari’s Plastica filter, which will shrink your nose, raise your cheekbones and give you a dangerously big pout, has been used over 200 million times. With the filters evidently huge popularity,
        Solari’s words echo a larger division that many like her insist upon – you don’t have to look real, especially on social media. “Procedures existed long before filters. Even before social media,” she reinforces. “Instead of helping vulnerable
        users build strength by giving them the tools to make choices and take responsibility, they’re victimising them, while at the same time shaming everyone else who wants to use filters for fun.”</p>
      <br>
      <p>With an increasing popularity, filters are no longer just for AR experts. Artists and Instagram fanatics alike are trying their hand at the new skill, as what previously was a niche and highly specific medium moves into the public eye thanks to
        easy access to software, training, and a growing community of filter artists helping each other out. However, the acceptance process is not so easy, with many hanging on to the months-long waiting list to Instagram’s Beta programme to finally
        get their filter shared worldwide. </p>
      <br>
      <p>What software are people using to make these effects? Facebook-owned creation software Spark AR Studio does the job well and quickly, and also includes tips and tricks for those beginning to feel their way into this world. The software makes pointers throughout the process of creating a filter, with the aim of making the filter accessible to as many people as possible, and therefore ‘more shareable.’</p>

      <p>And yet, perhaps the sharing of a filter that graphically changes prominent features of the face to thousands, if not millions of users on Instagram, isn’t the best idea. The Royal Society of Public Health released a report earlier this year
        discussing the impact of social media on mental health. They surveyed 1,500 young adults aged 14 to 24 and asked 14 questions about their mental wellbeing and usage of multiple social networks, including YouTube, Snapchat, Facebook,
        Instagram, and Twitter. Instagram scored the worst when asked about body image, with over fifty percent of those surveyed indicating it as the app that worsened their relationship with their body and self. ‘Snapchat or Instagram dysmorphia’,
        a term coined by doctors to describe the way filters and editing software cause people to feel pressured and anxious about how they look in reality, is becoming particularly prevalent in teens and young people who may look to get surgery to
        cure their dissatisfaction. <br> <br>

        Thanks to Snapchat and Instagram, today’s most popular procedures include steps to get fuller lips, a thinner face, and larger eyes. Researchers from Boston University underline where the frustration may be coming from when it comes to the apps themselves. "It is known that the angle and close distance at which selfies are taken may distort facial dimensions and lead to
        dissatisfaction,” the researchers state. People now reach for surgery and procedures to allow them to look the same way they do on social media as they do in real life. Whilst it used to be popular to bring in photos of celebrities to achieve
        a similar look surgically, many now bring in photos from social media or what they look like with a certain filter.
        <br><br>
        With all this in mind, I wanted to see just how easy it could be to make a filter worthy of Instagram, and how it could make me feel in the process.

      <h1 style="font-size: 23px; color: black;"><strong>Two Faced</strong></h1>
      <p>After downloading Spark AR, it becomes clear that the programme is designed for people to build their filters in layers, like multiple masks on top of one another, with functions enabled or disabled as needed. Face trackers are added to
        allow the camera to notice and understand the planes of the face, along with a ‘mesh’, a mask that sits on top of the face. The programme uses a checkerboard pattern as its default material. The material of the mesh is adjustable and can be
        styled as the user wishes, with properties like colour and texture. The property of ‘shader type’ allows for retouching and skin smoothing, or a mesh that is physically based, as it moves as the face does. I chose this mesh for my filter as I
        wanted it to fit the face as much as possible. </p>
      <br>
      <p>The environment feature allows the user to add a texture, many of which you can use from the app itself. By choosing the ‘sunrise’ effect, my filter took on a highly metallic sheen and reflective look. I made the surface parameter of the
        environment a little rougher, toning down the reflectiveness and then increased the metallic property. I changed the render option to an ‘addition’ blend which made the filter more moulded to the face, making the mask sit on top of the skin
        and look slightly more see-through than before. </p>

      <p>The filter becomes more reflective throughout the process, becoming mostly the work of two lights that the software includes – the ambient light and the directional light. This is what creates the futuristic, shiny effect of the filter that
        I was going for. The directional light is directed looking downwards and also straightforward, and by turning it up and down we can increase and decrease the intensity. I added another directional light and moved the position to the left and
        changed the colour of the light to a pink tone. With another directional light moved to the right, I added a green colour and changed the rotation of both lights slightly. </p>
      <br>
      <p>The shiny filter now begins to fully take shape and can be played around with as the user wishes. However, there is a very clear edge where the filter begins and then ends. I added another face mesh into the face tracker, and changed the
        material. I then added a different texture from the face tracker which extracted the texture of the face underneath the mask. This allowed for a second face tracker with a mesh of my own face. As shown in the video, I essentially have a mask
        of my face over my face, which explains the oddities in my mouth and eyes when I move them. The second mesh allows for more smoothness in the outer edge of the filter so that it becomes less harsh. </p>

      <p>I used a graphics editor to make a background where the edges were much darker than the centre so that the filter looked softer and more flared towards the edge. The lines that were initially rather prominent around the edge of the mask look
        much more natural. Once done, in line with the platform’s tip to help ensure the filter works for a maximum amount of people, I tested it out on the sample faces the software comes with, looking for faults or issues. I tested it using my
        webcam again and adjusted it a little more. The filter isn’t perfect, as I think my contrasting background may have confused it slightly, and it pulls a little around the edges of the mouth and eyes, but it looks like an Instagram filter
        nonetheless. </p>
      <br>
      <p>I tested my filter on my phone by downloading the Spark AR Player app on the iOS App store. After connecting my phone to my laptop, Spark AR on my computer invited me to send the filter to a device. I selected my phone, and was able to use
        it from there, taking pictures and videos with it. The next step would then be to upload the filter from Spark AR to Facebook and deploy it, allowing others to try it out. The whole process, along with some research, a few tutorials, and a few
        mistakes, took less than forty minutes.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The filter’s subtlety speaks volumes about trends on social media and what filters can do. Whilst it is not always the aim of the
        creator to make the user look more ‘attractive’ or ‘better-looking’ with their filter, the effect is still present – the user still looks slightly unnatural, healthier than usual in an odd way, thanks to the glow their skin has, and somewhat
        disappointed when it becomes time to look back in the mirror.</p>

        <h1 style="font-size: 22px; color: black;"><strong>Saving Face</strong></h1>

        <p>All this to say that social media, particularly Instagram, isn’t real. The images and thoughts posted to these apps showcase only what people want to show – authenticity is not the goal nor the outcome of most of the posts on
          applications
          like these. Our connection with technology can lead some down more ‘dangerous’ paths, especially in relation to mental health. Aiming to recreate someone’s seemingly perfect life, hair, skin, style, can only lead to inner negativity
          and unhappiness as research shows. </p>
        <br>

        <p>Filters that completely change the state of your face into something unnatural create another feeling entirely. Filters that are more experimental and warp faces don’t seek to make the user more attractive in the traditional sense, but
          instead reach for something else, looking to make the user something more than what they are. Our endless connection with technology is changing our views of our bodies and ourselves in another way than just culturally – thumb and wrist
          tendonitis is seen more regularly due to our never-ending texting, and more people are afflicted with back and neck pain thanks to how long we spend looking at our phones each day. Already, social media and technology makes us less human
          physically: where's the harm in looking different or unnatural on Instagram?</p>
        <br>
        <p>It’s becoming clear that digital effects are more accessible and usable than ever before. Whatever our cultural suggestion may be to looking ‘real’ or not on social media, 3D filters and face swapping effects aren’t going anyway any time
          soon. In daily, real life, we already use our face to open up our smart phones, our fingerprints to enter gyms and buildings, and facial recognition cameras in public areas are now in use more often than not. It is rapidly becoming harder
          to ‘opt in’ to areas of life where your face is logged into a dataset with your apparent ‘consent’ – another reason as to why people may wish to change their appearance. </p>

      <div class="text" align="right">

        <p>In a more sinister and highly AI focused realm of the internet comes the next level of face filters: deepfakes. The technology used by apps like Instagram and Snapchat to create filters that swap faces in pictures and videos has been
          around for many years, but these are often short-lived, and rarely produce believable results. When evidence emerged showing how easy it was to swap faces in videos using AI, the concept of deepfakes evolved very quickly and with a frightening
          intensity. </p>
        <br>
        <p>On a base level, the term ‘deepfake’ refers to any video where someone has either swapped or digitally altered the faces of the people in it. An existing video is replaced with someone else’s face or likeness, and so creates a ‘synthetic’ form of
          media. A mishmash of the words ‘deep learning’ and ‘fake’, deepfakes use powerful techniques from machine learning to create or manipulate visual and audio content that could potentially misinform and mislead those who see it. In a way, the
          same form of deception could be applied to filters from Instagram and Snapchat – however, deepfakes come with a much higher risk factor. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Whilst most deepfakes currently online are made by amateurs, they still have a very real power to damage people’s lives and reputations. Deepfakes often go viral as many deepfakes feature pornographic images of people, mostly female
          celebrities whose likeness is used without their consent – actresses Gal Gadot, Emma Watson, and Daisy Ridley have all been victims of pornographic deepfakes hitting news headlines. The AI behind deepfakes relies on huge resources of
          images, making celebrities the perfect targets and more convincing deepfakes possible. </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          After deepfakes appeared online on Reddit in 2017, the website banned sexually explicit deepfakes in 2018. Twitter followed suit not long after, removing and banning all deepfakes as they called them ‘involuntary pornography.’ By then, it
          was too late – deepfakes were being created in multiple corners of the internet, deepfake porn was easy to find online, and the means by which deepfakes were being created expanded.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Deepfake technology can impact our lives in many positive ways. As AI-related video and photo editing techniques improve, the future of deepfake AI stretches far beyond what it is currently being used for. Film, gaming, and fashion
          industries could benefit hugely from developing AIs, and so allow people to better understand deepfake technology, rather than fear it. </p>

        <p>Nowadays, creating a deepfake is relatively easier than it sounds. Programmes and apps now allow for multiple levels to deepfake creation, from paying someone else to do it for you to using a powerful GPU (graphics processing unit), huge
          amounts of footage, and taking time to do it yourself. Online tutorials and videos can be followed and completed in a day as the technology becomes easier to understand. However, making more realistic deepfakes that are seamless requires a
          deeper programming knowledge and more commitment, along with an understanding of the kind of network deepfakes rely on called autoencoders. I decided to try out a simple way of making a deepfake and see how far I could go with my current
          knowledge.</p>

        <p>I tried out Avatarify, a programme that superimposes someone else's face onto yours in real-time, during video meetings on Skype or Zoom. I also had success with a collaborative open-source model, which is shown to the right. The code for
          both programmes is available on Github for anyone to use, and mostly just take downloading of programmes and libraries and a good knowledge of the command line to get it running. Both programmes are written mostly in Python, so any prior
          knowledge of the language is also helpful.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Like most other face-swap technologies such as deepfakes, both these programmes use an algorithm that is trained on a set face that you want to swap with, meaning that several images of the person’s face are needed if a successful
          animation is to occur. I selected pictures from the data given of actress Emilia Clarke in the television show Game of Thrones, and of current President of Russia Vladimir Putin respectively.</p>

        <p>Clearly, these are not well made deepfakes. What allows many to discern potentially a real video of a politician criticising another from a fake is often visible giveaways. Areas like the mouth can make it more obvious, and the lip
          synching of the audio can be bad. Any kind of flickering means the video is likely fake, particularly around the edge of the ‘face’, and the details of the video can often be peculiar. The eyes and lines of sight can look strange and any
          form of turning the face, such as in my deepfake of Emilia Clarke, can cause distortion. Issues with jewellery and teeth can be more of the finer details that indicate the viewer is watching a deepfake as they can render badly, and any kind
          of light flash or reflection. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Whilst most of these sets of code can be run on any computer, they struggle to work as efficiently on MacBook’s, as the computer/laptop’s GPU is often not powerful enough. This means that the resulting video can run very slowly. However,
          when there is a potentially harmful and fake video of yourself out there, sometimes quality and speed are not the concerns most worth focusing on. There is no longer a need for the creator to have hundreds of photographs of the face being
          swapped - a 15-second Instagram story has 450 individual frames, more than enough to create a database of a face which a machine learning algorithm can use to render the face onto another body in a different video.</p>

        <h1 style="font-size: 23px; color: black;"><strong>Face Up To It</strong></h1>
        <p>One side to digital facial modification is the availability and fun element of filters and deepfakes. They’re enjoyable, can be funny, and are a good exercise for those feeling slightly more creative in a digital aspect. Faces will forever
          be a focal point of human existence – it is how we recognise, and more often than not, define someone. Cosmetic surgery is usually a mark of societal value, whether it truly makes you more ‘beautiful’, or it is just the mark of someone who
          can afford to change their face that way. Filters are free, they’re increasing in number on social media apps daily, and they’re reversible. </p>
        <br>
        <p>The ability to look tweaked, different, or like someone else entirely expands beyond filters in the digital world. Deepfakes are more prevalent than ever, whether used in a threatening and menacing way towards celebrities and victims, or
          in a political and strategic fashion against presidential candidates. Whilst the technology used to make deepfakes is more advanced than what is used to create filters, it is no less accessible and sometimes far easier to disseminate across
          the web, rather than waiting on a programme to allow your filter to be used worldwide. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Whilst neither the filter nor the ‘deepfakes’ I attempted to make are of professional quality, they still stand to make a point – if I can devote a day or so to each of them and achieve these results, it goes to show what a professional
          could do, and yet it is not certain that they will have spent as much time considering the implications of these on people’s private and personal lives or even their self-esteem. Obviously, the solution is not to eradicate both from the
          internet, and the likelihood of it being possible to do so is also very minimal. The technology used to make both these digital realities possible is prevalent in many online experiences, and proves to be increasingly popular during times
          where people are unable to go outside during the Coronavirus pandemic.</p>
        <br>
        <p>These technologies aren’t going away any time soon, and many look to decipher whether their harm outweighs their potential for good. Augmented facial reality holds close the notion that humans look to the face first, but also plays off the
          idea that the ability to recognise a face plays an important role in a human’s social life. If we’re no longer able to do so, or one face can be replaced for another – what are we really faced with? </p>
